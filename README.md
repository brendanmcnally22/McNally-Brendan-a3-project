Welcome to Frisson 

A simple 2D Platforming game where you have to avoid hazards, collect albums, and reach the exit to get to the next level!

A couple things to note, the player can jump 'underneath' the platform to the top of it in a sense, This is on purpose, the players collision is setup to where they will snap to the top of the platform once colliding. 
This is a game mechanic used to make the game more challenging and fun while also making it more simple to code for myself. 

You can use either WASD or a Controller.
