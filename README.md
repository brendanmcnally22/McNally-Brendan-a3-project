Welcome to Frisson 

A simple 2D Platforming game where you have to avoid hazards, collect albums, and reach the exit to get to the next level!

A couple things to note, the player can jump 'underneath' the platform to the top of it in a sense, This is on purpose, the players collision is setup to where they will snap to the top of the platform once colliding. 

This is a game mechanic used to make the game more challenging and fun while also making it more simple to code for myself. 
Please note to finish Level 2 you MUST use this feature to your advantage to snap to the top of the final platform. 

You can use either WASD or a Controller to move.

Space or Square to Jump! 

Hazards (RED) Take down your health by an increment of 10, they do not instantly kill you. It takes down your health fast, This is on purpose please collect albums to make sure you can pass every level! 

Albums (YELLOW) Are collectibles that give you +50 health when picked up, for some of the levels, you need to pick these up.

Exit (GREEN) The Green Box is the exit, Making contact with this will bring you to the next level. 

I hope you enjoy :)


Also, Just a little fun fact Frisson is the feeling of goosebumps when your listening to music!
